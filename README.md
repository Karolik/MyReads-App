## Description of the app

In this application, the books can be segregated into three different categories/shelves:
- Currently reading, 
- Want to read,
- Read.
Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.
If you select "none", the book will not be visible on any of the three shelves, however, you are able to add it later from the search page.

The search page allows you to find books to add to your library.
To open the search page, click the plus in the bottom right corner on the main page.
The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
You can navigate back to the main page by pressing the arrow. There you should instantly see all of the selections you made on the search page.

### Important
The search results are limited to a particular set of search terms, which you can find in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work.
