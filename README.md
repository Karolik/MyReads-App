## Instructions – how to use the app
instructions for installing and launching the project 

In this app the books can be segregated into three different categories/shelves:
Currently reading, Want to read and Read.
When you click a plus at the right bottom the search page will open. There you can search for more books and add them to the shelves.

## Important
The search results are limited to a particular set of search terms, which you can find in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work.
